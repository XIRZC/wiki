5.2. Links                                              *vimwiki-syntax-links*

Wikilinks~

Plain link: >
  [[This is a link]]
With description: >
  [[This is a link source|Description of the link]]
Wiki files don't need to be in the root directory of your wiki, you can put
them in subdirectories as well: >
   [[projects/Important Project 1]]
To jump from that file back to the index file, use this link: >
   [[../index]]
or: >
   [[/index]]
The latter works because wiki links starting with "/" are considered to be
absolute to the wiki root directory, that is, the link [[/index]] always opens
the file /path/to/your/wiki/index.wiki, no matter in which subdirectory you
are curently in.

Links to subdirectories inside the wiki directory are also supported. They
end with a "/": >
  [[a subdirectory/|Other files]]
Use |g:vimwiki_dir_link| to control the behavior when opening directories.

Typing wikilinks can be simplified by using Vim's omni completion (see
|compl-omni|) like so: >
  [[ind<C-X><C-O>
which opens up a popup menu with all the wiki files starting with "ind".

When |vimwiki-option-maxhi| equals 1, a distinct highlighting style is used to
identify wikilinks whose targets are not found.

Interwiki~

If you maintain more than one wiki, you can create interwiki links between
them by adding a numbered prefix "wikiX:" in front of a link: >
  [[wiki1:This is a link]]
or: >
  [[wiki1:This is a link source|Description of the link]]
The number behind "wiki" is in the range 0..N-1 and identifies the destination
wiki in |g:vimwiki_list|.

Named interwiki links are also supported in the format "wn.name:link" >
  [[wn.My Name:This is a link]]
or: >
  [[wn.MyWiki:This is a link source|Description of the link]]
See |vimwiki-option-name| to set a per wiki name.

Diary~

The "diary:" scheme is used to link to diary entries: >
  [[diary:2012-03-05]]
Anchors~

A wikilink, interwiki link or diary link can be followed by a '#' and the name
of an anchor.  When opening a link, the cursor jumps to the anchor. >
  [[Todo List#Tomorrow|Tasks for tomorrow]]
To jump inside the current wiki file you can omit the file: >
  [[#Tomorrow]]
See |vimwiki-anchors| for how to set an anchor.

Raw URLs~

Raw URLs are also supported: >
  https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki.git
  mailto:habamax@gmail.com
  ftp://vim.org
External files~

The "file:" and "local:" schemes allow you to directly link to arbitrary
resources using absolute or relative paths: >
  [[file:/home/somebody/a/b/c/music.mp3]]
  [[file:C:/Users/somebody/d/e/f/music.mp3]]
  [[file:~/a/b/c/music.mp3]]
  [[file:../assets/data.csv|Important Data]]
  [[local:C:/Users/somebody/d/e/f/music.mp3]]
  [[file:/home/user/documents/|Link to a directory]]
These links are opened with the system command, i.e. !xdg-open (Linux), !open
(Mac), or !start (Windows).  To customize this behavior, see
|VimwikiLinkHandler|.

In Vim, "file:" and "local:" behave the same, i.e. you can use them with both
relative and absolute links. When converted to HTML, however, "file:" links
will become absolute links, while "local:" links become relative to the HTML
output directory. The latter can be useful if you copy your HTML files to
another computer.
To customize the HTML conversion of links, see |VimwikiLinkConverter|.

Transclusion (Wiki-Include) Links~

Links that use "{{" and "}}" delimiters signify content that is to be
included into the HTML output, rather than referenced via hyperlink.

Wiki-include URLs may use any of the supported schemes, may be absolute or
relative, and need not end with an extension.

The primary purpose for wiki-include links is to include images.

Transclude from a local URL: >
  {{file:../../images/vimwiki_logo.png}}
or from a universal URL: >
  {{http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png}}
Transclude image with alternate text: >
  {{http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png|Vimwiki}}
in HTML: >
  <img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="Vimwiki"/>
Transclude image with alternate text and some style: >
  {{http://.../vimwiki_logo.png|cool stuff|style="width:150px;height:120px;"}}
in HTML: >
  <img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="cool stuff" style="width:150px; height:120px"/>
Transclude image _without_ alternate text and with a CSS class: >
  {{http://.../vimwiki_logo.png||class="center flow blabla"}}
in HTML: >
  <img src="http://vimwiki.googlecode.com/hg/images/vimwiki_logo.png"
  alt="" class="center flow blabla"/>
A trial feature allows you to supply your own handler for wiki-include links.
See |VimwikiWikiIncludeHandler|.

Thumbnail links~
>
Thumbnail links are constructed like this: >
  [[http://someaddr.com/bigpicture.jpg|{{http://someaddr.com/thumbnail.jpg}}]]
in HTML: >
  <a href="http://someaddr.com/ ... /.jpg">
  <img src="http://../thumbnail.jpg /></a>
Markdown Links~

These links are only available for Markdown syntax.  See
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link.

Inline link: >
  [Looks like this](URL)
Image link: >
  ![Looks like this](URL)
Reference-style links: >
  a) [Link Name][Id]
  b) [Id][], using the "implicit link name" shortcut
Reference style links must always include two consecutive pairs of
[-brackets, and field entries can not use "[" or "]".


NOTE: (in Vimwiki's current implementation) Reference-style links are a hybrid
of Vimwiki's default "Wikilink" and the tradition reference-style link.

If the Id is defined elsewhere in the source, as per the Markdown standard: >
  [Id]: URL
then the URL is opened with the system default handler.  Otherwise, Vimwiki
treats the reference-style link as a Wikilink, interpreting the Id field as a
wiki page name.

Highlighting of existing links when |vimwiki-option-maxhi| is activated
identifies links whose Id field is not defined, either as a reference-link or
as a wiki page.

To scan the page for new or changed definitions for reference-links, simply
re-open the page ":e<CR>".r
