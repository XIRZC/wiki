5.12. Tags                                               *vimwiki-syntax-tags*

You can tag a wiki file, a header or an arbitrary place in a wiki file. Then,
you can use Vim's built-in tag search functionality (see |tagsrch.txt|) or
Vimwiki's tag related commands to quickly jump to all occurrences of the tag.

A tag is a sequence of non-space characters between two colons: >
        :tag-example:
<
It is allowed to concatenate multiple tags in one line: >
        :tag-one:tag-two:
<
If placed in the first two lines of a file, the whole file is tagged.  If
placed under a header, within the 2 lines below it, the header is then tagged
with this tag, and the tag search commandswill jump to this specific header.
Otherwise, the tag stands of its own and the search command jumps directly to
it.

Typing tags can be simplified by using Vim's omni completion (see
|compl-omni|) like so: >
  :ind<C-X><C-O>
which opens up a popup menu with all tags defined in the wiki starting with
"ind".

Tags are also treated as |vimwiki-anchors| (similar to bold text).

                                                          *vimwiki-build-tags*
Note that the tag search/jump/completion commands need certain metadata saved
in the wiki folder.  This metadata file can be manually updated by running
|:VimwikiRebuildTags|.  When the option |vimwiki-option-auto_tags| is enabled,
the tags metadata will be auto-updated on each page save.


Tags-related commands and options:
   * |:VimwikiRebuildTags|
   * |:VimwikiGenerateTagLinks|
   * |:VimwikiSearchTags|
   * |vimwiki-option-auto_tags|
