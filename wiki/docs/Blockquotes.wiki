5.9. Blockquotes                                  *vimwiki-syntax-blockquotes*

Text which starts with 4 or more spaces is a blockquote.

    This would be a blockquote in Vimwiki. It is not highlighted in Vim but
    could be styled by CSS in HTML. Blockquotes are usually used to quote a
    long piece of text from another source.
